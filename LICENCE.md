They generally forbid alteration of their content (e.g., survey questions and/or answers) and use for commercial purpose, which usually means the direct sale of the survey instruments. They often do allow use of their content in commercial software, medical record and other clinical database systems, and the messaging of patient information collected through the use of these instruments."
